# Resident Services

## About

The model was built using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), exported as a `.stl` file, imported into [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/), sliced and the result is saved as a `.gcode` file. This print was designed around it being printed on a Prusa Mini+.

> _**IMPORTANT:**_ It is never recommended to print from someone elses gcode files. Please use the STL files in your slicer of choice and generate the gcode on your own. Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you! Enjoy these prints!
